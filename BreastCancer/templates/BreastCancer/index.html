          <p>Breast  cancer  is  the most  common  type  of  cancer  among women which
              is highly heterogeneous, and caused by the  interplay of hereditary and
              environmental risk factors . It is caused by irregular growth of cells
              in the breast tissue, which leads to the creation of tumors that could
              be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Nearly, 25% of deaths
              due to breast cancer are in the women aged from 40 to 49 years.
              This type of cancer is rarely seen before the age of 25â€“30, but it has been
              reported even in adolescent women. Based on the statistics published by
              the World Health Organization, one  in 8  to 10 women suffers  from breast cancer.
              Breast cancer can be categorized into two, which are malignant breast cancer and benign breast cancer.
